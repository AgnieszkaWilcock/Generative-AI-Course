    "* 2017, Deep Learning, a ML technique inspired by the wiring in our brains.  \"Neurons\" are connected into layers and the weights of the connections between neurons can be adjusted so that the neural net (NN) can \"learn\".\n",
    "* 2021, Generative AI, create new content, which could be text, audio or video, given a prompt.  An extension of NNs using the transformer architecture.\n"
